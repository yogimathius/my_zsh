# Welcome to My Zsh

## Task
There are programs out there that everyone uses, and it’s easy to put their developers on a pedestal. Although developing large software projects isn’t easy, many times the basic idea of that software is quite simple. Implementing it yourself is a fun way to show that you have what it takes to be a real programmer.

## Description
Write your own Shell, is it possible?
Let's do it! :-)

## Installation
`make`

## Usage

```
./my_zsh
```

```
ls
pwd
cd ..
etc
```
